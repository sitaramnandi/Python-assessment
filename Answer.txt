Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

Ans-Python is general purpose because it is used in many real time application development.For Example-
          1-Development of Gaming Applications.
          2- Web Application development
          3- Data Visualization  etc..
In Python Programming Languages, Even we represent the data in lower level data like Binary, Octal and Hexa decimal , the High Level Programming Languages automatically converts into Decimal number System data, which is understanble by Programmers and end-users   and python is one High Level Programming Language.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
ans-In python Programming the programer nned not specify the data type and whose data type is dynamically Assigned by the Python Execution Enviroment .
So it is called dynamically typed language..

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
ans-A variable is notthing bt it a value which is enter by the end user in real time project.
     A variable is the combination of alphabate,number.digit,and special symbol(_)
     for Example=  x=10
                    _i1=50

   for Example-
               x=input("Enter ur Name")

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
1- default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function are 
               1-int()
               2-float()

8. What is type casting?
Ans-The process of converting one type possible value into anoter type of value is called type casting.
     Example-
               a=int(input("Enter the number:"))
               
Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why? 
Ans- Yes we can take More than one input from the user using single input() function by using split() function.
     a, ,b, c = input (“Enter your age: “).split ()

Q10. What are keywords?
Ans-Keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes and can’t be used for anything but those specific purposes.
    Example-if,else,True,Flase etc...

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans- No,we can not use keywords as variable.because they are special reserved words used for operfrom specific opertion.
     
Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans-Indentation reffers to white space before a statement.Python uses indentation to indicate a block of statement/code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?

       2-Assesment operator
       3-Logical operator
       4-Relational operator
       5-Bitwise operator
       6-Membership operator
       7-Indentity operator

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans-    / id called divison operator.Ex-10/3=3.333

      and // is called floor divison  Ex-10/2=3

               age=int(input("Enter The age:"))
     
               if age>=18:
                     print("I can vote")
               else:
                    print("I can't vote")

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
''''''
Ans- lst = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
     sum=0
     for i in lst:
          sum=sum+i
     print("Total Sum Of lst={}".format(sum))

Ans- while True:
          try:
               num1=int(input("Enter The first Number:"))
               num2=int(input("Enter the second number:"))
               num3=int(input("Enter The third number:"))
               if num2<=num1>num3:
                    print("{} Is greatest".format(num1))
               elif num1<num2>=num3:
                    print("{} Is greatest".format(num2))
               elif num1<=num3>num2:
                    print("{} Is greatest".format(num3))
               else:
                    print("All are equall")
