          1-Development of Gaming Applications.
          2- Web Application development
          3- Data Visualization  etc..
In Python Programming Languages, Even we represent the data in lower level data like Binary, Octal and Hexa decimal , the High Level Programming Languages automatically converts into Decimal number System data, which is understanble by Programmers and end-users   and python is one High Level Programming Language.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
ans-In python Programming the programer nned not specify the data type and whose data type is dynamically Assigned by the Python Execution Enviroment .
So it is called dynamically typed language..

Q70. What is the difference between for and while loops?
Ans- When we know the exact number of iterations, we can use for loop. When we want the to run till a certain condition is true we can use while loop.

Q71. What is the use of continue statement?
Ans- continue statement used to making the pvm to go the top of loop with out execute statement which is writen under continue statement.
     continue statement are not execute statement which is writen under continue statement bt it is execute else part and other part of the program.

Q72. What is the use of break statement?
Ans- Break is keyword. The purpose of break statement is that "To terminated the execution of loop Logicaly when certain condition is satisfied and pvm comes of corresponding loop and execute other statement in the program.

Q73. What is the use of pass statement?
Ans- The pass statement is used as a placeholder for future code.

     When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens, but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed.

     Empty code is not allowed in loops, function definitions, class definitions, or in if statements.
